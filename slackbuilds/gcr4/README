GCR is a library for displaying certificates and crypto UI, accessing
key stores. It also provides the viewer for crypto files on the GNOME
desktop.

GCK is a library for accessing PKCS#11 modules like smart cards, in a
(G)object oriented way.

Note: This is the gtk4 implementation of gcr, which is different than
the gcr version that comes with Slackware.

This build has the gtk documentation disabled to avoid depending on
gi-docgen. You can set GTKDOC=true to build the gtk documentation and
have the gi-docgen dependency installed.
