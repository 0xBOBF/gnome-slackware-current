After acquiring or installing a new system there are a few essential 
things to set up before use. gnome-initial-setup aims to provide a 
simple, easy, and safe way to prepare a new system. 

This should only include a few essential steps for which we can't 
provide good defaults:

 - Select your language
 - Get onto the network
 - Create a user account
 - Set the correct timezone / location
 - Set up online accounts
 - Learn some basics about GNOME

The desired experience is that the system boots straight into the
initial-setup tool, and when the setup tasks are completed, we smoothly
transition into the user session for the newly created user account.
To realize this experience, we rely on gdm to launch 
gnome-initial-setup in a 'first boot' situation. We are using 
gnome-shell in an 'initial-setup' mode that shows a somewhat reduced UI,
similar to the way it is used on the login screen.

Note: The parental controls feature has been disabled in this build.
Enabling this feature adds 'malcontent' as a dependency.
